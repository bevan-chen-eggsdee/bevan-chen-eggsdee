Hellooooo everyone!!

I'm a newbie in the Web Development scene but love to make new innovative and cool products using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, React, Javascript, and many more :D

As a recent grad from Dev Academy, I have learnt numerous skills and have made awesome projects which I have displayed on my main page =3

I'm most proud of the Randomiser. project which was a final group project at Dev Academy where we collectively in a 5 person group made an app using a new programming language (to us) React Native and Firebase to create an Outfit Randomisng Application. This was extremely fun to make and an awesome outcome when it was completed. 

I hope to be able to create more awesome projects with others people in the future and learn even more than what I know already!
